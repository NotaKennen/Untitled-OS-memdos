This is an operating system I'm working on. Currently untitled, nicknamed memdos, I will probably come up with a better name when it's closer to being done.

As it's still a WIP, it doesn't have many (if at all) features. At the time of writing, it includes basic string printing and formatting, alongside extremely basic memory management (if you can even call it that). I'm planning on adding drivers for sound and keyboard, although that will probably take a while.
